Crowdfunding Platform using JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite.js
This project is a crowdfunding platform built using JavaScript as the programming language, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Vite.js as the build tool. The platform allows users to create campaigns and raise funds for their projects, while other users can contribute to those campaigns.

Project Structure
The project structure is as follows:

php
Copy code
crowdfunding-platform/
  |- public/             # Public assets
  |- src/                # Source code
       |- assets/        # Static assets
       |- components/    # Reusable UI components
       |- pages/         # Application pages
       |- services/      # API services
       |- styles/        # CSS styles and Tailwind CSS configurations
  |- .gitignore          # Git ignore file
  |- package.json        # Node.js dependencies and scripts
  |- README.md           # Project README file
The public directory contains static assets like images, fonts, and other files that should be served as-is.

The src directory contains the main source code of the application:

The assets directory is used to store static assets specific to the application.
The components directory contains reusable UI components that are used across the application.
The pages directory contains individual pages of the application.
The services directory contains modules responsible for handling API communication.
The styles directory contains CSS styles and Tailwind CSS configurations.

The crowdfunding platform is built using the following technologies and libraries:

JavaScript: The programming language used to build the application logic.

Vite.js: A fast build tool and development server that enables quick development and build times.
Axios: A promise-based HTTP client library used for making API requests.
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
